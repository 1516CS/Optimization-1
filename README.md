### Description: Optimizing Rocket Engine Production for Maximum Profit  

This project revolves around the optimization of a production schedule for rocket engines in a fully automated rocket-building company. The company aims to maximize profit through the efficient utilization of available resources, including raw materials and manufacturing machines.  

#### Key Elements of the Case Study  

- **Production Requirements**:  
  Each rocket engine consists of specific parts:  
  - **Part A**: 1 unit required  
  - **Part B**: 2 units required  
  - **Part C**: 4 units required  

- **Cost Considerations**:  
  Production costs vary based on the parts required for the rocket engine.  

- **Machine Resources**:  
  Two manufacturing machines operate continuously:  
  - **Machine Availability**: 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.  
  - Machines have varying production times for each part. (Details provided in the associated table).  

#### Objective  
To create an optimized production schedule that ensures:  
1. **Efficient resource allocation**: Minimizing wasted materials and time.  
2. **Maximized profitability**: Producing rocket engines at an optimal cost while meeting production goals.  

By analyzing this case study and implementing a robust optimization strategy, this project seeks to provide actionable solutions for maximizing efficiency and profitability in rocket engine manufacturing.  

## Manufacturing Hours and Cost per Unit

| Part | Machine 1 (hours) | Machine 2 (hours) | Cost per unit |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| A    | 3                 | 2                 | $20           |
| B    | 2                 | 1                 | $15           |
| C    | 1/2               | 1                 | $10           |
