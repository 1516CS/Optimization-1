Cost per engine => $20*1 + $15*2 + $10*4 = $90
Profit per engine => $300 -$90 = $210
Operating hours for a machine per week => 24*7 = 168

Decision variables:
	E = Number of engines	
	X1 = Number of A parts from Machine 1 per week			
	X2 = Number of B parts from Machine 1 per week			
	X3 = Number of C parts from Machine 1 per week			
	Y1 = Number of A parts from Machine 2 per week			
	Y2 = Number of B parts from Machine 2 per week			
	Y3 = Number of C parts from Machine 2 per week	
		
Objective: Maximize the profit  
Objective function:  Profit = 210E

Business constrains:
	Hours of Machine 1: 3X1 +2 X2 + 0.5X3 <= 168
	Hours of Machine 2: 2Y1 + Y2 + Y3 <= 168
	Number of A parts: X1 + Y1 = E
	Number of B parts: X2 + Y2 = 2E
	Number of C parts: X3 + Y3 = 4E
	Non-negativity: X1, X2, X3, Y1, Y2, Y3, E >= 0
